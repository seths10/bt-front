<h1 align="center"> Bus Tracking System </h1>
<p align="center">This development research aims to increase productivity and reduce time mismanagement among students who rely on buses for transportation. The study proposes a system that includes hardware and software components to track multiple buses on campus and display their location data in real time through a mobile application.</p>


### Description
 - Our solution mainly consists of hardware and software components.
   
 - The front end was created using React and VuePWA. We wanted
   our solution to reach the masses, and that's why we chose to use these technologies.
  
 - For the backend, we used Node.js, as it was easier to
   integrate with React, without any hassle to manage & create
   instances of our server.
